# Breast Cancer Prediction Project

## Overview
The Breast Cancer Prediction Project is a machine learning initiative aimed at developing a neural network model to predict whether a breast cancer tumor is benign or malignant. This project involves data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization using Python.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of 569 entries and 31 columns, containing various mean, error, and worst-case measurements of cell nuclei from breast cancer biopsies. The target column is an integer indicating the diagnosis (malignant or benign).

### Features
- **Mean Measurements**: mean radius, mean texture, mean perimeter, etc.
- **Error Measurements**: radius error, texture error, perimeter error, etc.
- **Worst-case Measurements**: worst radius, worst texture, worst perimeter, etc.
- **Target**: 0 (benign) or 1 (malignant)
